// TODO: Without this empty file, the Bridging-Headers, and specifying a Swift version in the project settings, the Example doesn't build. Let's check if there's a better way to address this.
// If this is the only way, we should add the steps to add those in the projects that want to use react-native-inputkit. In our goalie-2-mobile-app we already have them by default.
